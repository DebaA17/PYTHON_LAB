# 🛡️ Security Policy

We take security seriously… well, as seriously as one can while sipping coffee and coding at 3 AM. ☕💻  

If you stumble upon a bug, glitch, or full-blown security issue in this project, we’d love to hear about it—responsibly, of course.

## 🐞 Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Reach Us
- Send an email to: **security@bppimt.com**  
- Or send a carrier pigeon. (Carrier pigeons are slower, but more fun.) 🕊️

### What Happens Next
- We’ll confirm we got your report. (Usually within 7–14 coffee breaks ☕)  
- We might ask for more details if your report is as mysterious as a plot twist in a thriller.  
- We’ll fix the issue as soon as we can, but remember: we code in human time, not superhero time. 🦸  

### Bounties
- Do we provide money? Nope. 💸  
- Do we provide eternal glory and bragging rights? Absolutely. 🏆  
- You get our undying gratitude, a virtual high-five, and maybe a meme in your honor.  

### Status Updates
- We’ll keep you posted if your vulnerability is accepted or declined.  
- If we decline it, don’t worry—you’ll still get a digital thank-you note… maybe with a cat gif. 🐱  

### Remember
Report responsibly. Don’t go trying to hack the coffee machine… unless you really need more caffeine. ☕
